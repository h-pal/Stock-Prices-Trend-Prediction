# Stock_Prices_Prediction_LSTM
Stock prices prediction using LSTM on different datasets
We are using RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS to predict stock prices, which in recent times have shown excellent results in projects involving sequential datasets such as in Image Caption Generation, Text Classification, Natural Language Processing etc. STOCK PRICE TREND PREDICTION using RNN is a process of predicting the trend of stock prices whether the market is showing an upward trend or downward. 

The project can be used to guess whether it is a good time to invest money in a particular firm or not. If there is a start in upward trend, one should consider investing in that firm but if the trend is beginning to decline, one should avoid investing in that firm.

Although Share prices are affected by a lot of Factors that cannot be predicted like Economic conditions, Political factors, Natural calamities etc. but still the model shows a robust performance and can be used on any type of share dataset to predict the trend.
